# JSON-List-Problems


I am new to JSON formatting, so I wanted to start with an example. I am using this from the PnP GitHub site https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/view-samples/contact-card-format . I have 2 exactly the same lists, one on my dev tenant and one on production. I have the one on my dev tenant working perfectly. After copying & pasting on the production site, the production site does not display correctly. Some elements are there, but most are not. What am I missing?Note: I did create 2 keys for the Goggle maps API for each domain. That is literally the only difference between the 2 JSON files.
